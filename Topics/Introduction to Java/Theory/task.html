<h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p><strong>Java </strong>is a general-purpose modern programming language. The term "general-purpose" indicates the extensive range of capabilities Java offers. With Java, the possibilities are virtually limitless. The key feature of the language is <strong>platform independence</strong>: it means that the same Java program can be run on multiple platforms without any changes! This principle is also known as "write once, run anywhere" (or WORA).</p><p>Being one of the most popular languages in programming for many years, it has earned the top position in the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TIOBE</a> index (a general-purpose programming language popularity index). This robust programming language is used by a huge community of software developers around the world! If you have a problem, you can always ask other developers or find a suitable answer online.</p><p>This fundamental programming language is used in a wide variety of domains such as the financial services industry, telecommunications, embedded systems, in our Android smartphones to run mobile applications, and many other areas. Medical enterprise applications use it to store patient files, computer games, such as Minecraft, are created using Java; development tools like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse wouldn't exist without it.</p><h5 id="a-sample-of-java">A sample of Java</h5><p>Let's create the classic "Hello, World!" program, a friendly greeting from your computer.</p><p>Here's the program:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}</code></pre><p>Don't worry if it looks a bit cryptic now. You'll get the hang of it soon. </p><p>This program simply prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. But there's a lot going on here:</p><ul><li><p><strong>public class HelloWorld</strong> - This is like the birth certificate of our program. We're telling Java we're creating a new public class (a kind of blueprint) and we're naming it HelloWorld. Every Java application has to have at least one class.</p></li><li><p><strong>public static void main(String[] args)</strong> - This is the heart of our program, where the JVM begins execution of the program. </p></li><li><p><strong>System.out.println("Hello, World!");</strong> - These are our program's first words! This command instructs Java to print "Hello, World!" to the console, providing instant feedback.</p></li></ul><p>And there you have it, your first Java program! It's a modest step, but it marks the beginning of an exciting journey into Java programming.</p><h5 id="a-short-history-overview">A short history overview</h5><p>Java was initially developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sun Microsystems</a>, and is currently owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Oracle Corporation</a>. The language project was initiated in 1991 by James Gosling and his colleagues. In the beginning, the language was called "Oak." Later the project was renamed as a reference to Java coffee. For this reason, the languageâ€™s logo is a cup of coffee.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><picture><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/480x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/960x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1440x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/800x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1600x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2400x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1100x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2200x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/-/stretch/off/-/resize/3000x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Java logo" height="428" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6b2b0c7a-8b69-4701-947c-b869bef018ba/" width="234"/></picture></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The logo of the Java language</strong></p><p>Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0 in 1996. After that, new versions were released every 1 to 3 years. Since Java 9, released in 2017, new versions have been released every 6 months. Starting from Java 11, every third major release is designated as an LTS version, which receives a minimum of 8 years of support. This allows organizations and developers to use stable, long-term supported versions of Java, ensuring reliability and security in their application development. You can read more about Java's history and its versions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">on Wikipedia</a>. Hyperskill currently supports versions up to Java 17.</p><h5 id="some-important-features-of-java">Some important features of Java</h5><p>As we've mentioned before, the most important feature of Java is <strong>platform independence</strong>. This is achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When Java code is compiled, it is converted into platform-independent bytecode, which is executed by the JVM. At runtime, the JVM translates the bytecode into machine code. As a result, Java programs can run on any system that has a JVM.</p><p>Another important feature is a <strong>plain </strong>and <strong>clear syntax</strong>. Many elements of this simple language are easy to read and are widely used in other programming languages such as C/C++, C#, JavaScript, and Go.</p><p>If you have ever written programs in C/C++, you know that manual memory management can lead to bugs in the source code. Fortunately, the Java programming environment has a <strong>garbage collector</strong> that <strong>automatically cleans memory</strong> garbage from unused content during runtime.</p><p>It is also important to note that Java supports multiple programming paradigms; you will get to know more about them in future topics. As it's primarily an imperative language based on object-oriented programming, almost every part of a program is an object. Therefore, a program itself can be considered as a set of interacting objects. Also, it partially supports modern programming paradigms such as <em>generic programming, concurrent programming, functional programming</em>, and some others.</p><p>Java is one of the most popular programming languages, and many large systems and applications are based on it. Some well-known examples include application servers such as Apache Tomcat, JBoss, and WebLogic. Because of its reliability and performance, Java has been widely used in many large systems. It has been used to write popular services such as Netflix, Uber, and Spotify. Amazon uses Java to develop their web services.</p><p>Java has a huge active developer community. There are many forums, blogs, chat rooms, and websites where you can find help, tips, and programming guides. <br/>There are also many libraries and frameworks based on Java, for example, Spring and Hibernate, which greatly simplify application development and extend the functionality of the language. With such a large community, Java developers have access to a wealth of knowledge, experience and support that contributes to the successful development and support of Java projects.</p><p>If you are a beginner in programming, it may be difficult to comprehend all the methods, complex features and key concepts of Java right now. This is not a bad thing. Throughout this set of topics, you will learn about all of these key concepts. Also, Java Docs have comprehensive <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online documentation</a> that comprises guides, tutorials, specifications, API documentation, technical information, and more. We will refer you to it from time to time during your studies.</p><p>All in all, Java is a modern and popular programming language that can be successfully used in almost all domains.</p>
